# CIE2_TUM
This is a program to interpolate a set of given points using B-splines, written during the course CIE2 of Techincal University of Munich

## Introduction
Welcome to my open-source project repository for my Master's degree project at TUM Computational Mechanics - School of Design and Engineering.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a computational model for interpolating points using the B-spline theory

### Goals
- Understand B-spline theory
- Visualize simulation results for better understanding.
